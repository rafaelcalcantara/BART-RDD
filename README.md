# Code for BARDDT paper
## Simulation experiments
Folder `Simulations` contains the scripts to perform our simulations. In order to reproduce our results, run the scripts in the following order.
1. File `generate_master_scripts.R` generates scripts to run the simulations for each of the 6 DGPs analyzed in the paper. Alternatively, one can alter lines 2-7 to generate simulation scripts for different DGPs. Lines 8-23, which are commented out, set 2 values for each parameter (one 'easy', one 'hard'). If one wants to explore the simulation setup in more detail, just comment out lines 1-7 and un-comment lines 8-23 to generate simulation scripts for each of those parameter combinations (128 total).
2. Files `run_simulations.R` creates the necessary folders to store the results, sources `generate_master_scripts.R`, and produces a shell command to execute each simulation script.
3. The simulation scripts source file `simulation_estimation_cluster.R` or `simulation_estimation_local.R`, depending on whether we set `cluster <- TRUE` (resp. `cluster <- FALSE`) in `run_simulations.R`. The main difference here is that the former executes the simulation scripts in batches of samples (for running many samples of the same DGP in parallel; useful if we have access to a cluster or even a local PC with good processing power), while the latter executes the scripts sequentially. The number of batches for the parallel execution can be set in line 64 of `generate_master_scripts.R`. Currently, we set `cluster <- TRUE` so the simulations are run in parallel, and recommend leaving that as is even for local runs, unless processing is really an issue.
4. The `estimation` files source:
    a. `simulation_estimator_functions.R`, which create the functions that fit each of the models, and a function `fit_general`. This function sources `simulation_data.R`, which generates the data for a given sample of the current DGP, and executes each of the model functions on this sample
    b. `simulation_process_results.R`, which creates functions to process the results for each DGP, generating the RMSE and CATE fits
5. File `simulation_plots.R` produces the figures and table from the simulation section in the paper
